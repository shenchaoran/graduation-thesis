 abstract={Atmospheric measurements indicate that the terrestrial carbon sink increased substantially from the 1980s to the 1990s, but which factors and regions were responsible for the increase are not well identified yet. Using process- and remote sensing-based ecosystem models, we show that changes in climate and atmospheric CO 2 in the period 1981√¢¬Ä¬ì2000 enhanced net ecosystem production (NEP) and caused major geographical changes in the global distribution of NEP. In the 1980s the Americas accounted for almost all of the global NEP, but in the 1990s NEP in Eurasia and Africa became higher than that of the Americas. The year-to-year variation in global NEP was up to 2.5 Pg C (1 Pg = 10 15 g) , in which 1.4 Pg C was attributable to the El Ni√É¬±o Southern Oscillation cycle (ENSO). NEP clearly decreased in El Ni√É¬±o and increased in La Ni√É¬±a in South America and Africa, but the response in North America and Eurasia was mixed. The estimated NEP increases accounted for only 30% of the global terrestrial carbon sink but can explain almost all of the increase from the 1980s to the 1990s. Because a large part of the increase in NEP was driven by the long-term trend of climate and atmospheric CO 2 , the increase in the global terrestrial carbon sink from the 1980s to the 1990s was a continuation of the trend since the middle of the twentieth century, rather than merely a consequence of short-time climate variability.},

 abstract={Earth's vegetation plays a pivotal role in the global water balance. Hence, there is a need to model dynamic interactions and feedbacks between the terrestrial biosphere and the water cycle. Here, the hydrological performance of the Lund‚ÄìPotsdam‚ÄìJena model (LPJ), a prominent dynamic global vegetation model, is evaluated. Models of this type simulate the coupled terrestrial carbon and water cycle, thus they are well suited for investigating biosphere‚Äìhydrosphere interactions over large domains. We demonstrate that runoff and evapotranspiration computed by LPJ agree well with respective results from state-of-the-art global hydrological models, while in some regions, runoff is significantly over- or underestimated compared to observations. The direction and magnitude of these biases is largely similar to those from other macro-scale models, rather than specific to LPJ. They are attributable primarily to uncertainties in the climate input data, and to human interventions not considered by the model (e.g. water withdrawal, land cover conversions). Additional model development is required to perform integrated assessments of water exchanges among the biosphere, the hydrosphere, and the anthroposphere. Yet, the LPJ model can now be used to study inter-relations between the world's major vegetation types and the terrestrial water balance. As an example, it is shown that a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 content alone would result in pronounced changes in evapotranspiration and runoff for many parts of the world. Although significant, these changes would remain unseen by stand-alone hydrological models, thereby emphasizing the importance of simulating the coupled carbon and water cycle.},

 abstract={Interannual variation in terrestrial net primary production (NPP) was modeled using the global production efficiency model (GLO-PEM), a semimechanistic plant photosynthesis and respiration model driven entirely with satellite advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) observations. The model also estimated a wide range of biophysical variables at 10-day intervals for the period 1982√¢¬Ä¬ì1989, including air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, soil moisture, biomass, autotrophic respiration, canopy-absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, gross primary production, and light use efficiency. The accuracy of the simulated variables has previously been shown to be within 10√¢¬Ä¬ì30% of field measurements, depending on the specific variable. We analyze here interannual changes in NPP, which showed large spatial variability (0√¢¬Ä¬ì1500 gC m√¢¬à¬í2 yr√¢¬à¬í1) and trends that differed regionally over the 8-year period. Annually integrated global NPP was found to vary as much as 12% between years and was very sensitive to air temperature. The coefficient of variation in NPP of sparsely vegetated areas (mostly semiarid) on an interannual basis was as much as 80%, whereas densely vegetated areas (broadleaf evergreen and seasonally deciduous forests) varied comparatively little (0√¢¬Ä¬ì10%). Mean annual NPP of the latter decreased 36 gC m√¢¬à¬í2 yr√¢¬à¬í1 over the time series examined. There was extreme seasonal and moderate interannual variation (10√¢¬Ä¬ì60%) in NPP of middle- to high-latitude regions (temperate and boreal forests) with evidence for a slight trend toward increased values through time (+3 to 12 gC m√¢¬à¬í2 yr√¢¬à¬í1). The results indicate significant interannual and regional differences in responses to climate variability, with boreal regions increasing 39 gC m√¢¬à¬í2 yr√¢¬à¬í1 compared to a decrease of 116 gC m√¢¬à¬í2 yr√¢¬à¬í1 in tropical regions for each 1√Ç¬∞C rise in air temperature. We explore a few of the possible reasons for these observations and discuss some of the issues and limitations to the use of the current global AVHRR observational record.},

 abstract={The Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) is a program developed by the Task Force on Regional Climate Downscaling of World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). The Task ForceÈà•Ê™ö mandate is to develop a framework to evaluate regional climate downscaling techniques; foster an international coordinated effort to develop improved downscaling techniques and to provide feedback to the global modeling community; and promote greater interactions between global climate modelers, downscalers and end-users. Within this mandate, the primary goal of CORDEX is to extend to a global framework the lessons learned from regional climate downscaling programs focused on one continent. The framework includes statistical downscaling as well as regional climate models (RCMs), with an aim of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of downscaled climate information. CORDEX also provides coordination among existing and emerging downscaling programs around the world. This talk will emphasize the statistical downscaling component of CORDEX. CORDEX has defined a set of target regions covering most land areas of the planet. A primary region of emphasis is Africa, which has received less attention than most other continents in regional climate-change and climate-impacts research. Baseline downscaling efforts by statistical downscaling and RCMs have started, focusing on the period covered by the ERA-Interim Reanalysis: 1987-2007. Future work will include downscaling GCM output for extended periods in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, where future projections will be based on Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) greenhouse gas and aerosol scenarios, specifically RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. CORDEX has established a preliminary set of archival protocols and targeted variables for output that will be stored in a central, openly accessible repository. Although CORDEX intends to produce simulations and analyses for the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, the WCRP Task Force views CORDEX as an ongoing program that will extend beyond the IPCC AR5. This talk will outline ways in which interested groups can participate through simulation and analyses.},

 abstract={Winter precipitation (PR) characteristics in western United States (WUS) related to atmospheric river (AR) landfalls are examined using the observation-based PRISM data. The observed AR-related precipitation characteristics are in turn used to evaluate model precipitation data from the NASA MERRA2 reanalysis and from seven dynamical downscaling simulations driven by the MERRA2. Multiple metrics including mean bias, Taylor diagram, and twoËÅΩskill scores are used to measure model performance for three climatological sub-regions in WUS, Pacific Northwest (PNW), Pacific Southwest (PSW) and Great Basin (GB). All model data well represent the winter-mean PR with spatial pattern correlations of 0.8ËÅΩor higher with PRISM for the three sub-regions. Higher spatial resolutions and/or the use of spectral nudging generally yield higher skill scores in simulating the geographical distribution of PR for the entire winter. The PRISM data shows that the AR-related fraction of winter PR and associated daily PR PDFs in each region vary strongly for landfall locations; AR landfalls in the northern WUS coast (NC) affect mostly PNW while those in the southern WUS coast (SC) affect both PSW and GB. NC (SC) landfalls increase the frequency of heavy PR in PNW (PSW and GB) but reduce it in PSW (PNW). All model data reasonably represent these observed variations in the AR-related winter PR fractions and the daily PR PDFs according to AR landfall locations. However, unlike for the entire winter period, no systematic effects of resolution and/or spectral nudging are identified in these AR-related PR characteristics. Dynamical downscaling in this study generally yield positive added values to the MERRA2 PR in the AR-related PR fraction for most sub-regions and landfall locations, most noticeably for PSW by NU-WRF. The downscaling also generate positive added value in p95 for PNW, but negative values for PSW and GB due to overestimation of heavy precipitation events.},

All RCMs reasonably simulate the observed climatology of these variables. RCM skill varies more widely for the magnitude of spatial variability than the pattern. The multimodel ensemble is among the best performers for all these variables. Systematic biases occur across these RCMs for the annual means, with warm biases over the Great Plains (GP) and cold biases in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico (GM) coastal regions. Wet biases in the Pacific Northwest and dry biases in the GM/southern Great Plains also occur in most RCMs. All RCMs suffer problems in simulating summer rainfall in the Arizona-New Mexico region. RCMs generally overestimate surface insolation, especially in the eastern United States. Negative correlation between the biases in insolation and precipitation suggest that these two fields are related, likely via clouds. Systematic variations in biases for regions, seasons, variables, and metrics suggest that the bias correction in applying climate model data to assess the climate impact on various sectors must be performed accordingly. Precipitation evaluation with multiple observations reveals that observational data can be an important source of uncertainties in model evaluation; thus, cross examination of observational data is important for model evaluation.},

 abstract={While a new class of Dynamic Global Ecosystem Models (DGEMs) has emerged in the past few years as an important tool for describing global biogeochemical cycles and atmosphere-biosphere interactions, these models are still largely untested. Here we analyze the behavior of a new DGEM and compare the results to global-scale observations of water balance, carbon balance, and vegetation structure. In this study, we use version 2 of the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS), which includes several major improvements and additions to the prototype model developed by Foley et al. [1996]. IBIS is designed to be a comprehensive model of the terrestrial biosphere; the model represents a wide range of processes, including land surface physics, canopy physiology, plant phenology, vegetation dynamics and competition, and carbon and nutrient cycling. The model generates global simulations of the surface water balance (e.g., runoff), the terrestrial carbon balance (e.g., net primary production, net ecosystem exchange, soil carbon, aboveground and belowground litter, and soil CO2 fluxes), and vegetation structure (e.g., biomass, leaf area index, and vegetation composition). In order to test the performance of the model, we have assembled a wide range of continental and global-scale data, including measurements of river discharge, net primary production, vegetation structure, root biomass, soil carbon, litter carbon, and soil CO2 flux. Using these field data and model results for the contemporary biosphere (1965ËäíËÅôËÅ?1994), our evaluation shows that simulated patterns of runoff, NPP, biomass, leaf area index, soil carbon, and total soil CO2 flux agree reasonably well with measurements that have been compiled from numerous ecosystems. These results also compare favorably to other global model results.},

 abstract={Alpine swamp meadows on the Tibetan Plateau,with the highest soil organic carbon content across the globe,are extremely vulnerable to climate change.To accurately and continually quantify the gross primary production(GPP) is critical for understanding the dynamics of carbon cycles from site-scale to global scale.Eddy covariance technique(EC) provides the best approach to measure the site-specific carbon flux,while satellite-based models can estimate GPP from local,small scale sites to regional and global scales.However,the suitability of most satellite-based models for alpine swamp meadow is unknown.Here we tested the performance of four widely-used models,the MOD17 algorithm(MOD),the vegetation photosynthesis model(VPM),the photosynthetic capacity model(PCM),and the alpine vegetation model(AVM),in providing GPP estimations for a typical alpine swamp meadow as compared to the GPP estimations provided by EC-derived GPP.Our results indicated that all these models provided good descriptions of the intra-annual GPP patterns(R20.89,P0.0001),but hardly agreed with the inter-annual GPP trends.VPM strongly underestimated the GPP of alpine swamp meadow,only accounting for 54.0% of GPP_EC.However,the other three satellite-based GPP models could serve as alternative tools for tower-based GPP observation.GPP estimated from AVM captured 94.5% of daily GPP_EC with the lowest average RMSE of 1.47 g C m~(-2).PCM slightly overestimated GPP by 12.0% while MODR slightly underestimated by 8.1% GPP compared to the daily GPP_EC.Our results suggested that GPP estimations for this alpine swamp meadow using AVM were superior to GPP estimations using the other relatively complex models.},

 abstract={Climate and biophysical regulation of terrestrial plant production and interannual responses to anomalous events were investigated using the NASA Ames model version of CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) in a transient simulation mode. This ecosystem model has been calibrated for simulations driven by satellite vegetation index data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) over the mid-1980s. Relatively large net source fluxes of carbon were estimated from terrestrial vegetation about 6 months to 1 year following El NiÂ∏Ωo events of 1983 and 1987, whereas the years 1984 and 1988 showed a drop in net primary production (NPP) of 1-2 Pg (\$10^{15}\ {\rm g}\$) C from their respective previous years. Zonal discrimination of model results implies that the northern hemisphere low latitudes could account for almost the entire 2 Pg C decrease in global terrestrial NPP predicted from 1983 to 1984. Model estimates further suggest that from 1985 to 1988, the northern middle-latitude zone (between 30Êé? and 60Êé≥N) was the principal region driving progressive increases in NPP, mainly by an expanded growing season moving toward the zonal latitude extremes. Comparative regional analysis of model controls on NPP reveals that although Normalized Difference Vegetation Index "greenness" can alone account for 30%-90% of the variation in NPP interannual anomalies, temperature or radiation loading can have a fairly significant 1-year lag effect on annual NPP at middle- to high-latitude zones, whereas rainfall amount and temperature drying effects may carry over with at least a 2-year lag time to influence NPP in semiarid tropical zones.},

 abstract={A simulation model based on satellite observations of monthly vegetation cover was used to estimate monthly carbon fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems from 1982 to 1998. The NASA‚ÄìCASA model was driven by vegetation properties derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and radiative transfer algorithms that were developed for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). For the terrestrial biosphere, predicted net ecosystem production (NEP) flux for atmospheric CO 2 has varied widely between an annual source of ‚à?0.9 Pg C per year and a sink of +2.1 Pg C per year. The southern hemisphere tropical zones (SHT, between 0¬∞ and 30¬∞S) have a major influence over the predicted global trends in interannual variability of NEP. In contrast, the terrestrial NEP sink for atmospheric CO 2 on the North American (NA) continent has been fairly consistent between +0.2 and +0.3 Pg C per year, except during relatively cool annual periods when continental NEP fluxes are predicted to total to nearly zero. The predicted NEP sink for atmospheric CO 2 over Eurasia (EA) increased notably in the late 1980s and has been fairly consistent between +0.3 and +0.55 Pg C per year since 1988. High correlations can be detected between the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and predicted NEP fluxes on the EA continent and for the SHT latitude zones, whereas NEP fluxes for the North American continent as a whole do not correlate strongly with ENSO events over the same time series since 1982. These observations support the hypothesis that regional climate warming has had notable but relatively small-scale impacts on high latitude ecosystem (tundra and boreal) sinks for atmospheric CO 2.},

 abstract={A new model of global primary production (GLObal Production Efficiency Model, GLO-PEM), based on the production efficiency concept, is decribed. GLO-PEM is the first attempt to model both global net and gross primary production using the production efficiency approach and is unique in that it uses satellite data to measure both absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and also the environmrntal variables that affect the utilization of APAR in primary production. The use of satellite measurements gives global, repetitive, spatially contiguous and time specific observations of the actual vegetation. GLO-PEM is based on physiological principles, in particular the amount of carbon fixed per unit absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (Ëî?) is modelled rather than fitted using field observations. GLO-PEM is illustrated with the first available year (1987) of the 8ËÑ? 8 km resolution NOAA/NASA AVHRR land Pathfinder data set. The global net primary production, respiration and Ëî? values obtained indicate that even the rather simple AVHRR provides a wealth of information relevant to biospheric monitoring. The algorithms and results presented indicate that there are significant possibilities of inferring biological and environmental variables using multispectral techniques that need to be explored if the new generation of satellite remote sensing systems is to be exploited productively.},

 abstract={A new version of the ecosystem process model FOREST-BGC is presented that uses stand water and nitrogen limitations to alter the leaf/root/stem carbon allocation fraction dynamically at each annual iteration. Water deficit is defined by integrating a daily soil water deficit fraction annually. Current nitrogen limitation is defined relative to a hypothetical optimum foliar N pool, computed as maximum leaf area index multiplied by maximum leaf nitrogen concentration. Decreasing availability of water or nitrogen, or both, reduces the leaf/root carbon partitioning ratio. Leaf and root N concentrations, and maximum leaf photosynthetic capacity are also redefined annually as functions of nitrogen availability. Test simulations for hypothetical coniferous forests were performed for Madison, WI and Missoula, MT, and showed simulated leaf area index ranging from 4.5 for a control stand at Missoula, to 11 for a fertilized stand at Madison, with Year 50 stem carbon biomasses of 31 and 128 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Total nitrogen incorporated into new tissue ranged from 34 kg ha(-1) year(-1) for the unfertilized Missoula stand, to 109 kg ha(-1) year(-1) for the fertilized Madison stand. The model successfully showed dynamic annual carbon partitioning controlled by water and nitrogen limitations.},

 abstract={The asynchronous regional regression model (ARRM) is a flexible and computationally efficient statistical model that can downscale station-based or gridded daily values of any variable that can be transformed into an approximately symmetric distribution and for which a large-scale predictor exists. This technique was developed to bridge the gap between large-scale outputs from atmosphereÈà•Êêäcean general circulation models (AOGCMs) and the fine-scale output required for local and regional climate impact assessments. ARRM uses piecewise regression to quantify the relationship between observed and modelled quantiles and then downscale future projections. Here, we evaluate the performance of three successive versions of the model in downscaling daily minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation for 20 stations in North America from diverse climate zones. Using cross-validation to maximize the independent comparison period, historical downscaled simulations are evaluated relative to observations in terms of three different quantities: the probability distributions, giving a visual image of the skill of each model; root-mean-square errors; and bias in nine quantiles that represent both means and extremes. Successive versions of the model show improved accuracy in simulating extremes, where AOGCMs are often most biased and which are frequently the focus of impact studies. Overall, the quantile regression-based technique is shown to be efficient, robust, and highly generalizable across multiple variables, regions, and climate model inputs.},

Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes 'long term' simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere-ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of 'near term' simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These 'decadal predictions' are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive. For researchers unfamiliar with climate models, the limitations of the models and experiment design are described.},

To share and integrate these heterogeneous models, encapsulation studies should be conducted that are aimed at shielding original execution differences to create services which can be reused in the web environment. Although some model service standards (such as Web Processing Service (WPS) and Geo Processing Workflow (GPW)) have been designed and developed to help researchers construct model services, various problems regarding model encapsulation remain. (1) The descriptions of geo-analysis models are complicated and typically require rich-text descriptions and case-study illustrations, which are difficult to fully represent within a single web request (such as theGetCapabilitiesandDescribeProcessoperations in the WPS standard). (2) Although Web Service technologies can be used to publish model services, model users who want to use a geo-analysis model and copy the model service into another computer still encounter problems (e.g., they cannot access the model deployment dependencies information). This study presents a strategy for encapsulating geo-analysis models to reduce problems encountered when sharing models between model providers and model users and supports the tasks with different web service standards (e.g., the WPS standard). A description method for heterogeneous geo-analysis models is studied. Based on the model description information, the methods for encapsulating the model-execution program to model services and for describing model-service deployment information are also included in the proposed strategy. Hence, the model-description interface, model-execution interface and model-deployment interface are studied to help model providers and model users more easily share, reuse and integrate geo-analysis models in an open web environment. Finally, a prototype system is established, and the WPS standard is employed as an example to verify the capability and practicability of the model-encapsulation strategy. The results show that it is more convenient for modellers to share and integrate heterogeneous geo-analysis models in cloud computing platforms.},

 abstract={Geo-analysis models are necessary tools for understanding various geo-processes and phenomena in EarthÈà•Ê™ö environment. Studying, reusing, sharing and integrating geo-analysis models can help researchers solve complicated and synthetic geo-problems with interdisciplinary knowledge, especially for researchers who collaborate with each other to build virtual geographic environments (VGEs). While the integration frameworks of geo-analysis models could permit their practical use, it is essential for model users to prepare data according to the specific requirements of the different geo-analysis models. Model users should invest adequate effort and time into preparing such model data, particularly when employing multi-disciplinary geo-analysis models. This paper proposed a data description model, the Universal Data eXchange (UDX) model that can reduce the effort and difficulties of model data preparation and pre-processing for model users. With the UDX model, researchers from interdiscipline can build a collaborative workspace in VGEs more conveniently. A hierarchical structure was employed in the UDX model for the flexible description of heterogeneous model data, and a set of basic data node types was designed to provide a relatively stable organization method for the various data contents. In the UDX model, the structural format data (e.g., the Shapefile and NetCDF data) and the flexible plain text data content can be described in a uniform way. In addition, model data information can be completely and unambiguously described with the items in the attachment libraries (e.g., unit and dimension library, semantic library, spatial reference library, and data description template library). Furthermore, two different model integration case studies were conducted to prove that various data processing methods and efforts can be accumulated and organized with the designed UDX data processing library.},

 abstract={In recent years, the increasing development of cloud computing technologies laid critical foundation for efficiently solving complicated geographic issues. However, it is still difficult to realize the cooperative operation of massive heterogeneous geographical models. Traditional cloud architecture is apt to provide centralized solution to end users, while all the required resources are often offered by large enterprises or special agencies. Thus, it's a closed framework from the perspective of resource utilization. Solving comprehensive geographic issues requires integrating multifarious heterogeneous geographical models and data. In this case, an open computing platform is in need, with which the model owners can package and deploy their models into cloud conveniently, while model users can search, access and utilize those models with cloud facility. Based on this concept, the open cloud service strategies for the sharing of heterogeneous geographic analysis models is studied in this article. The key technology: unified cloud interface strategy, sharing platform based on cloud service, and computing platform based on cloud service are discussed in detail, and related experiments are conducted for further verification.},

In this study, we used the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) to evaluate the effects of climate change and elevated CO2 concentration on the temporal and spatial variation of carbon budget pattern in the terrestrial ecosystem in China during 1960 to 2006. The results from the model were validated against forestry inventory and flux observation data, and compared with other data from previous publications. The following results were obtained: (1) IBIS accurately simulated the carbon budget pattern of the terrestrial ecosystem of China. The highest net primary productivity (NPP) was observed in southeastern and southwestern China, while the lowest NPP was distributed in northwestern China. (2) The NPP showed an increasing trend from 1960 to 2006 in all climate zones except in the wet-warm-temperate zone. From 1960 to 2006, the total NPP of the terrestrial ecosystem of China showed an increasing trend at a rate of 6 MtC/a and the range of NPP was between 2.2 GtC/a and 2.7 GtC/a, with a mean value of 2.46 GtC/a; peak values occurred in 1990, 1993, 1996, 1998, and 2002. (3) In 11 climate zones, NPP was significantly correlated with precipitation and temperature, and precipitation was the main limiting factor except in the wet-middle temperate, cold temperate, plateau temperate, and plateau frigid zones. (4) The net ecosystem productivity (NEP) showed that most terrestrial ecosystems in China acted as carbon sinks. Only the dry-warm-temperate zone in northwestern China and the southwestern part of the Tibet plateau acted as a small carbon source, while Daxinganling, Xiaoxinganling, and Changbai mountains as well as southeastern and southwestern China acted as large carbon sinks. (5) The NEP showed a significant increasing trend in the wet-middle-temperate, plateau temperate, and plateau frigid zones, while other zones remained in a stable state from 1960 to 2006. The total NEP of the terrestrial ecosystem of China also showed an increasing trend at a rate of 1.6 MtC/a and the range of NEP was between -0.10 GtC/a and 0.25 GtC/a, with a mean value of 0.11 GtC/a from 1960 to 2006. (6) The NEP showed a stronger correlation with precipitation than temperature. Except for temperature, precipitation, increasing CO2, land-use change, and the program of Grain for Green were also among the most important factors caused the change in the carbon budget of China, and the response of terrestrial ecosystem to these factors will be the priority for future research. Above all, IBIS produced reasonable and reliable results on the terrestrial carbon budget in China, and these results can be applied in predicting the potential of carbon sequestration and providing the scientific basis for regional carbon management.},
